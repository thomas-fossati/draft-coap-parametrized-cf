                  Parametrized Content-Format for CoAP
               draft-fossati-core-parametrized-cf-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a "parametrized" CoAP Content-Format data
   item that allows supplementing a Content-Format with additional media
   type parameters.

   This document also defines two new CoAP Options, Parmetrized-Content-
   Format and Parametrized-Multi-Valued-Accept, that build upon the
   "parametrized" Content-Format data item to work around some of the
   limitations of the existing Accept and Content-Format Options.

1.  Introduction

   CoAP squashes the combination of a media type, media type parameters
   and content coding into a single Content-Format number.  (For an
   example, see Section 16.10 of [RFC8152].)  This number is carried in
   the Content-Format and Accept Options.

   This compression strategy is ideal in cases where the set of possible
   combinations is known upfront and has small cardinality.  However, it
   lacks the flexibility to deal smoothly with situations where the
   number of combinations can grow unbounded.

   An example is [I-D.lundblade-rats-eat-media-type], in which the
   "profile" media type parameter can carry a number of different values
   that are constantly minted through a loosely regulated process.

   To avoid the combinatorial explosion that derives from such premises,
   this document defines the "parametrized" Content-Format data item
   (Section 3) as a mechanism to enrich a given Content-Format with
   additional media type parameters.

   Two new CoAP Options that build upon such data item are also defined:

   *  Parametrized-Content-Format (Section 4)

   *  Parametrized-Multi-Valued-Accept (Section 5)

   The latter also works around the limited content negotiation
   capabilities of the CoAP Accept Option by allowing to accept more
   than one Content-Format per request.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Parametrized Content-Format

   The Parametrized Content-Format is a CBOR [STD94] data item defined
   by the CDDL [RFC8610] in Figure 1.

   The first element in the tuple is the Content-Format identifier,
   followed by zero or more name-value pairs representing the additional
   media type parameters.

   The name-value pairs are optional to support the case where the
   Parametrized Content-Format is used in Parametrized Multi-Valued
   Accept Option (Section 5).

   parametrized-content-format = [
     content-format,
     * [ parameter-name, parameter-value ]
   ]

   content-format = 0..65535

   parameter-name = textual / numeric
   parameter-value = any

   textual = text .abnf ("parameter-name" .det RFC6838-parameter-name)
   numeric = int

   RFC6838-parameter-name = '
     parameter-name = restricted-name

     restricted-name = restricted-name-first *126restricted-name-chars
     restricted-name-first  = ALPHA / DIGIT
     restricted-name-chars  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "!" / "#" /
                              "$" / "&" / "-" / "^" / "_"
     restricted-name-chars =/ "." ; Characters before first dot always
                                  ; specify a facet name
     restricted-name-chars =/ "+" ; Characters after last plus always
                                  ; specify a structured syntax suffix

     ALPHA         =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A  ; A-Z / a-z
     DIGIT         =  %x30-39            ; 0-9
   '

   // TODO describe use of numeric identifiers as alias for parameter
   // names (requires a new registry).

3.1.  Requirements

   The list that follows details the semantic requirements that a
   Parametrized Content-Format data item must satisfy:

   *  The intersection between the media parameters already encoded in
      the Content-Format identifier and the set of parameters carried in
      the name-value pairs of the Parametrized Content-Format MUST be
      empty.

   *  Each name-value pair MUST be a registered parameter for the media
      type.

   If any of the conditions listed above is not met, the entire data
   item is considered invalid and MUST NOT be processed further.

3.2.  Examples

   [
     65000,
     [ "p1", "a-string-value" ],
     [ "p2", 128 ]
   ]

4.  Parametrized Content-Format Option

   +========+=+===+===+===+================+========+========+=========+
   | Number |C| U | N | R | Name           |Format  | Length | Default |
   +========+=+===+===+===+================+========+========+=========+

   +--------+-+---+---+---+----------------+--------+--------+---------+

                Table 1: Parametrized Content-Format Option

   The Parametrized Content-Format Option carries a CBOR-encoded
   Parametrized Content-Format data item.

   pcf-option-fmt = bytes .cbor parametrized-content-format

            Figure 3: Parametrized Content-Format Option Format

   The semantic is identical to the Content-Format Option described in
   Section 5.10.3 of [RFC7252].

5.  Parametrized Multi-Valued Accept Option

   +========+===+===+===+===+==============+========+========+=========+
   | Number | C | U | N | R |Name          |Format  | Length | Default |
   +========+===+===+===+===+==============+========+========+=========+
   | TBD13  | x |   |   |   |Parametrized  |See     |        | none    |
   |        |   |   |   |   |Multi-Valued  |Figure 4|        |         |
   |        |   |   |   |   |Accept Option |        |        |         |
   +--------+---+---+---+---+--------------+--------+--------+---------+

              Table 2: Parametrized Multi-Valued Accept Option

   The Parametrized Multi-Valued Accept Option carries a single CBOR-
   encoded Parametrized Content-Format data item or two or more
   Parametrized Content-Format data items as a CBOR array.

   one-or-more<T> = T / [ 2* T ]

   pmva-option-fmt = bytes .cbor one-or-more<parametrized-content-format>

          Figure 4: Parametrized Multi-Valued Accept Option Format

   The semantic is identical to the Accept Option described in
   Section 5.10.4 of [RFC7252], except for the ability to list more than
   one acceptable (parametrized) Content-Format, which is key to enable
   finer-grained content negotiation.

   The Content-Formats are listed in order of preference.  If more than
   one match is found, the entry with the lowest index in the array MUST
   be selected.
